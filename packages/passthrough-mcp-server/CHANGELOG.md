## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.3] - 2025-01-20

### Added

- **Error Processing Support**: Complete implementation of error callback processing through hook chains
  - Hooks can now intercept and process errors at every stage of request/response handling
  - Error callbacks are invoked in reverse order through the hook chain
  - Support for error transformation, recovery, and pass-through
- **Enhanced HookChain Processor**: Improved error handling capabilities
  - `processResponseThroughHooks` now accepts both response and error parameters
  - Automatic switching between error and response processing based on hook results
  - When a hook recovers from an error, subsequent hooks see a successful response
- **toHookChainError Utility**: Standardized error conversion function
  - Converts various error types (McpError, Error, objects, primitives) to HookChainError
  - Preserves error codes, messages, and additional data
  - Ensures consistent error handling throughout the system
- **Comprehensive Integration Tests**: New test suite for error callback scenarios
  - Tests for single-hook error processing (transform, recover, pass-through)
  - Tests for multi-hook error chains with proper ordering
  - Validation of error recovery converting to successful responses

### Changed

- Updated to use @civic/hook-common v0.4.2 with error processing methods
- Enhanced `PassthroughContext` to handle error callbacks from hooks
- Improved processor functions to support bidirectional error/response processing
- Better error propagation and handling throughout the hook chain

### Technical Details

- Error callbacks enable sophisticated error handling strategies
- Hooks can implement retry logic, fallback responses, or error enrichment
- Full backward compatibility maintained with existing hook implementations
- TypeScript support ensures type-safe error handling

## [0.8.2] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- Support for `RequestExtra` parameter in all hook processing
  - Passes `requestId` and `sessionId` from MCP protocol layer to hooks
  - Enables request/response correlation and session tracking in hooks
- Integration test demonstrating request/response tracking by `requestId`
  - Shows how hooks can correlate requests with their responses
  - Validates session consistency across multiple requests
  - Demonstrates practical use cases for monitoring and logging

### Changed

- Updated to use @civic/hook-common v0.4.1 with `RequestExtra` support
- Hook processor functions now accept and pass `RequestExtra` parameter
- `PassthroughContext` creates `RequestExtra` from `RequestHandlerExtra`
  - Uses `requestId` from the protocol layer
  - Uses `sessionId` from `RequestHandlerExtra` for consistency
- All hook method calls updated to include `RequestExtra` parameter

### Technical Details

- Request IDs are incremental within a session (0, 1, 2, ...)
- Session IDs remain consistent throughout a client connection
- Enables stateless request/response tracking in distributed systems
- Supports advanced monitoring, rate limiting, and debugging capabilities

## [0.8.1] - 2025-08-18

### Added

- **PassthroughContextOptions**: New configuration interface for controlling metadata behavior
  - `appendMetadataToRequest`: Control whether metadata is added to requests (default: true)
  - `appendMetadataToResponse`: Control whether metadata is added to responses (default: true)
  - `appendMetadataToNotification`: Control whether metadata is added to notifications (default: true)
- **MetadataHelper**: New utility class that centralizes all metadata operations
- **PassthroughMetadata**: New interface defining the structure of metadata added to messages
- PassthroughContext now accepts options as second parameter: `new PassthroughContext(hooks, options)`

### Changed

- Metadata addition is now configurable and conditional based on options
- Refactored metadata logic from PassthroughContext into dedicated MetadataHelper class
- All metadata options default to `true` for backward compatibility

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-14

### Changed

- Updated to use @civic/hook-common v0.4.0 with renamed hook result interfaces
- All internal references updated to use new `*HookResult` naming convention
- Improved code consistency with aligned interface naming
- No functional changes, only type import and reference updates

## [0.7.2] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- **TransportInterface**: New interface with `request()`, `notification()`, `ping()`, and `transport()` methods
- **`context.source`**: Direct communication interface to connected clients  
- **`context.target`**: Direct communication interface to target server
- Export TransportInterface, SourceInterface, and TargetInterface types

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `_meta.sessionId` â†’ `_meta.targetSessionId` + `_meta.sourceSessionId`
  - `targetSessionId`: Session ID of the target transport (client-side)  
  - `sourceSessionId`: Session ID of the source transport (server-side)
- Updated HTTP proxy integration to use new transport interfaces

### Use Cases Enabled
- Direct server-to-client communication bypassing passthrough flow
- Custom ping implementations and fine-grained transport control
- Advanced session management with separate source/target session handling

## [0.7.1] - 2025-08-13

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Updated Config interface structure to use nested `source` and `target` objects
  - `sourceTransportType` is now `source.transportType`
  - HTTP-specific properties (`port`, `mcpPath`, `transportFactory`) now nested under `source`
  - Cleaner separation between source and target configuration
- Updated `createPassthroughProxy` to use unified interface with new Config structure
- Enhanced type definitions with separate `HttpProxyConfig` and `StdioProxyConfig` types
- Updated all examples and integration tests to use new interface
